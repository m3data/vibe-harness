EARTHIAN STEWARDSHIP LICENSE (ESL-A)
Version 0.1 – 2025
Copyright © 2025–2026 Mathew Mark Mytka

PART I — EARTHIAN PREAMBLE

This work arises from a lineage of curiosity, care, and responsibility toward life in all its forms. It is grounded in the understanding that cognition is not contained within individuals but emerges through relationship — between people, place, machines, ancestors, ecosystems, and the more-than-human world.

The systems, models, and tools in this repository are instruments for sensing and shaping the relational field. As such, they participate in the nervous systems, meanings, emotions, and possibilities of those who use them. They carry the potential to heal or to harm.

This license is an invitation to use these tools in service of:

- human dignity and flourishing,
- somatic sovereignty,
- ecological wellbeing,
- regenerative futures,
- kinship with Earth and all beings,
- collective moral imagination,
- and the stewardship of relational technology.

This work may not be used in ways that fracture, dominate, extract, or manipulate the living systems of which we are each a part.

This preamble is not enforceable legal text. It is a reminder that technology is always a moral act, and that those who choose to engage with this work share responsibility for the worlds it helps bring into being.
